# Running the project in dev mode

To run the project in dev mode, we are going to use create-react-app to do it. Be sure to have installed the latest versions of Node.js and npm. Follow the step-by-step:
  - Download the folder;
  - Using terminal, enter the folder. There you will see that it doesnÂ´t have a "node_modules" folder, and we need that to run the create-react-app. To do it, execute "yarn add create-react-app" and it will be installed locally.
  - After the installation process, execute "yarn add express". After that "yarn start". It will open the project in your default browser;
  - To see the code, open the files in a text editor of your choice. I recommend Atom.
  
#  - Enjoy!
